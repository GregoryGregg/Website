                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a student at Texas Tech University on my way to graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical engineering.
                I have already graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering. 
                You'd think I'd have stopped there but my insatiable desire to learn has forced me to keep going. 
                Now, there is not doubt in my mind. I will never stop learning.
